# Welcome to SciArt the model! 
## Project Mission 
The goal of this project is to create a generalizable and ranked model for using visual art to communicate science research directly from science researchers to the public. Using visual art, this model will seek to engage and educate the public by demonstrating the creative aspects of science.
## Summery
Visual art and science are both creative fields that work within a paradigm of uncertainty and ambiguity. This model will promote inclusivity in STEM fields by helping researchers directly communicate their information to the public in an easy to understand and engageable way. Using a learning strategy called visual thinking strategies, this model will use open questions and visual art to communicate difficult science concepts in an approachable way.
