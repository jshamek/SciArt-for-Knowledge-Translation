### SciArt_for_Knowledge_Translation 


# Welcome to SciArt!
### This project seeks to...
* Engage the publics existing knowledge to help them understand science research
* Promote inclusivity in science by welcoming different types of learning and promoting the creative nature of science research
* Create a ranked and generalizable open source model available to all science researchers

## There is a gap between researchers and the public 
Due to the high degree of specificity required, the language that scientists use to describe their research is often next to impossible for the public to understand. This leads to people who might be from different backgrounds or think differntly to be excluded from understanding science and potentially becoming scientists. Science is a creative field and there is space in science for people from all walks of life. Not only is there space, but these people are needed in order to move science foward.

## How do we address this Gap?
Education and outreach are two key componants of every successful science research project. However, while science eduation research has made huge strides in the last decade, the research has yet to be translated into tools for researchers to use. This project seeks to address that gap by creating an open access, tested model that is generalizable enough for all types of scientists to apply to their own research and educate the public. 

## How does visual art fit into it?
Visual art is accessable and is creative like science. Open ended questions encourage people to think creativly about a subject without making them feel as if they aren't "smart enough" to participate.
