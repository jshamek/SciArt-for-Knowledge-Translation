### SciArt_for_Knowledge-Translation 


# Welcome to SciArt!
## This project seeks to...
Use art to explain hard to understand ideas
Promote inclusivity in science by welcoming different types of thinkers

## There is a gap between researchers and the public 
The way that scientists communicate their research is hard for non-science people to understand. This leads to people who might be from different backgrounds or think differntly to be excluded from understanding science or becoming scientists. Science is a creative field and their is space in science for people from all walks of life!!! Not only is there space, but these people are needed in order to move science foward.

## How do we address this Gap?
Education and outreach are two key componants of every successful science research project. However, education research is lacking. This project seeks to address that gap by creating an open access, tested model that is generalizable enough for all types of sience researchers to use. 

## How does visual art fit into it?
Visual Thinking Strategies blurb
Visual art is accessable and is creative like science. Open ended questions encourage people to think creativly about a subject without making them feel as if they aren't "smart enough" to participate.
